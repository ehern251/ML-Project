       " \"Fall Guys was a game I was really looking forward to when it was first announced, and there is decent potential there.  But this game is just not all that good. And honestly, not much fun. Almost immediately, the PC version was overrun with cheaters running speed hacks, which caused me to walk away quickly.  Decided to give it a second chance a couple weeks later, and now the game is even worse because of the lack of a skill queue.  New players will always be placed at a significant disadvantage as veteran players will know the proper routes and shortcuts through the maze races.  And while I could just 'git gud' by failing repeatedly until I also learn the shortcuts from the few, unchanging levels, I honestly found myself just not caring enough to bother.  Fall Guys falls flat. \",\n",
       " \"You gotta love it. The aesthetics are very colorful and charming, and the gameplay brings a lot of joy and fun. It's like going to a new theme park as a child, but then it turns out it's your chance at a Wipeout course that you always wanted to try to beat for yourself, then mixed with a highly addictive battle royal formula. Perfect in short bursts between work or a discord party evening. Mediatonic still hasn't said the last word, as they will still continue to develop the game, add new modes etc. without which this game would probably not go on for a long time, and they have built a great basis to do so, so let's hope they will made right choices as this game's got a lot of potential and a lot of paths it could follow. If it continues to ride the popularity wave correctly, then in a few months or years it's gonna probably deserve a higher score.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>PS. How they managed to pull off that style of their Twitter account I have no idea, but I absolutely love it. Their social media deserve 10/10 score. \",\n",
       " 'When we covered Fall Guys last week during it’s beta, we talked about how fun the game was with its crazy courses and bounce all over the place with your adorable jellybaby like characters. But expressed concern about its longevity from the variety of courses we played, however, we expected that what we were playing was just a mere taste and expected to see a bunch more in the fall game.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Sad to say that hasn’t exactly been the case.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>For anyone not aware, Fall Guys is a brand new attempt at Battle Royale, where you play as bizarre little creatures who have a terrible centre of gravity and “wooo” everytime they get knocked over. The game plays a lot like Takeshi’s Castle and Wipeout with many similar obstacle courses like running through doors and avoiding the fake ones, only with more crowding and flailing all over the place. That is the one thing you need to expect while playing Fall Guys, it is going to become an absolute squabble especially when squeezing into such tight places. You play through several rounds trying to avoid getting eliminated in the process and compete for the crown at the end.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The game does like to mix it up at times with team-based challenges that usually involve pushing balls, grabbing eggs and chasing people wearing a tail. These can prove quite frustrating, but in that lighthearted funny way as you try desperately to get an egg from your opponent’s goal and just flop everywhere. But other times like the Rocket League knock off can just feel tiresome as you try and shove your ball into the goal.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Longevity is going to be the real deal-breaker of this game, I actually found myself getting bored back while playing the beta and was ready to write off the full game when I started playing it today. That is until I won the crown in my first game and modes I didn’t get to play in the beta like Royal Fumble, which involves scrambling for the one tail, were actually quite fun to play. One thing that would be great to see is some variety to each of the levels because then you are just playing the same ones over and over again.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The truth is, Fall Guys feels like that quick little game you boot up between other bigger games, its the little snack break in-between titles or the one you play with something else in the background. Much like Tetris 99, it’s best to play Fall Guys in small bursts throughout the day rather than a marathon session. However, the 20$ price tag may deter some players especially the ones who are used to seeing Battle Royale games like this as free to play. However, it seems the game is available for free for PS Plus members.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The game does offer cosmetics like new costumes, colours and emotes which are paid for with the games two main currencies, Kudos and Crowns. Kudos is the currency you receive after any match you play (unless the servers disconnect half way through) or purchased with real money but Crowns can only be achieved by winning a game or reaching certain levels. With the lack of lootboxes, I have to praise the game for how it treats its unlockables. The game will offer rare items like an Alyx HL2 outfit for a limited time, but it can only be bought with crowns which are only earned in-game and sure you could buy Kudos with real money but you earn plenty playing as well, so why even bother?\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Fall Guys is just some real light-hearted fun, something you open up after a long tiresome day and maybe get a few laughs from, and during these times, that is really all you can ask for. ',\n",
       " \"I like how Fall Guys adapted Mario Party and made it support up to 60 players. It's a nice little casual game to get your feet wet with competitive gaming, without the stress and anxiety involved.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Sadly, the game in its current state is lacking. It is good, don't get me wrong, but it is still very much an infant that has yet to grow to its full potential. There aren't that many minigames to play (around 10-15 at most), so it gets stale playing through the same ones over and over.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>There is a lot of randomness to many of the minigames, and the team-based ones are pretty much a coin flip. (The yellow team is almost always doomed to lose, to the point that you might as well quit the game and join another to save time and energy.) The maps are split into game modes which follow a specific sequence, which means that if you do not reach the final round, you are forced to grind through the same handful of initial maps again, which don't require much skill.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Anyone who has played Fall Guys for more than a few hours will tell you the exact same thing: There are not enough minigames. Since the game just released, I'm sure the developers will add more as time goes on, but it simply feels incomplete in its current state. The game will feel fresh for the first day or two, but then it turns more into a grindfest which you alt-tab out of whenever there is downtime between maps.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Overall, it is hard to justify the game at its current price, and I recommend holding off until there are at least 20-30 minigames. If and when that happens, supposing I am still playing the game by then, I may consider revising my score. \",\n",
       " \"Absolutely love this game.  I can't put it down!   You can absolutely get any skin in the game just by playing it.   Perfect \",\n",
       " \"Team modes ruin this game.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Nearly every single mode in which you play by yourself is awesome and a ton of fun, and every single team mode without a single exception is absolute garbage. Unfun, unfair, frustrating garbage. Every. Single. One of them.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>What that results in is a game in which half the time you're have a ton of fun and the other half you're having a miserable time. Add that to the battle royale gameplay, which means you will frequently have excellent runs ruined by being placed in the losing team and being able to do **** all about it, and the overall experience takes a massive hit.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>If this game had an option to queue for a no team mode playlist, I could easily give it an 8 or 9 out of them, the only other significant problem being how repetitive the game is, but I don't feel like I'm being hyperbolic when I say the team modes ruin an otherwise awesome game. \",\n",
       " \"With the servers largely fixed and them finding their groove, I can see this game lasting for a good long while as the shiny new thing.  I can't say this is going to be a Fortnite or even a PUBG in terms of how long it will last.  Gamer tend to hate things when they go mainstream which makes about as much sense as shooting yourself in the foot because you hate macaroni.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>It's physics based silliness in the vein of MXC and Wipeout.  Honestly at this point, if you don't know what it is... Welcome to video games... because that's the only way you couldn't have heard of it by now. \",\n",

This game is very fun even when I play solo sometimes and is different from other battle royale games.

For example, there's a remarkable lack of variety when it comes to stages and music. I've played the game for about an hour now and stuff just keeps on repeating endlessly.  I also think that the game would be more fun if you could actually hit each other, or maybe use Mario Kart-like items on each other. Just more ways to actually interact besides just falling onto and grabbing each other.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>On the plus side, I had absolutely no problems with the matchmaking, though the game was a little laggy sometimes.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I actually got a refund for this on Steam.

       " 'Fall Guys is one of the most thoroughly enjoyable games I\\'ve played in recent memory; the premise of a minigame battle royale is a truly great one, and Fall Guys executes this well with surprisingly tight controls and a slew of incredible minigames to take full advantage of this gameplay style. Minigames such as Hex-A-Gone and Slime Climb are incredibly fun with a relatively high skill ceiling, and make for incredibly tense and fun sessions. However, the base roster of minigames is somewhat sparse, and several of them don\\'t reach the same highs as the ones mentioned above, with many of the team minigames and Picture Perfect feeling antithetical to the game\\'s appeal. Still, the majority of the minigames are solid, and even the worst of Fall Guys\\' games can provide enjoyment and fun memories. As long as Fall Guys\\' dedicated developers continue to release other strong minigames, this game is sure to keep some staying power and become more than the \"flavor of the month\" some claim it to be, and I look forward to seeing how they do.

Overall I\\'m satisfied to play this and I will keep playing it, because it\\'s really fun.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>*e.g. in Duo Mode with 60 players, instead of requiring 42 solo players advance to next stage (in solo way), require 21 teams to advance, in this way there\\'s teamwork.

       " 'Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout\\r<br/>A great game that falls flat\\r<br/>Fall Guys is a 60 person battle royal gameshow where you take on 59 other players in attempt to grab the fall guys crown.\\r<br/>Fall Guys is super accessible and easy to jump into, you only have to worry about 3 controls, jump, dive grab, that’s all you need to do a you race through obstacles against other players, battle each other in team modes, and dodge obstacles round by round, players slowly getting eliminated until the 5th and final championship round…\\r<br/>At first Fall Guys is super addictive, its bright, its colorful, the obstacles are fun and frustrating too! But frustrating in a good way! You never get upset when you’re eliminated, you just dust yourself off and go back at it… and based on how far you get in each episode, you’ll be rewarded points to spend in the shop… and this is where fall guys falls flat on its face.. Content… fall guys ultimate knockout is lacking content big time, and while yes I understand this game is free for PlayStation plus members at the time of this review, fall guys ultimate knockout is not a free game... I repeat, this is not a free to play game...\\r<br/>There are 24 mini games, but with 5 rounds an episode, you get to see all this game has to offer fairly quickly.. That being said that’s not necessarily fall guys biggest problem in the content department... the biggest problem is in its customization... a huge lack of customization options, the store changes every day rather than you saving up your kudos or crowns for a special item you actual want… which leads to thousands of players, looking pretty identical which I feel defeats the whole purpose of a game like a fall guys, this is an individual game show, give me more options to feel like an individual, rather than be a bird or a be a wolf, sorry about the servers you can be a cactus, thanks for the 3 options..\\r<br/>overall I really love fall guys, its dumb fun and really hard to put down, there are a few mini games that can sour the fun a bit like tip toes, and obviously people that find ways to cheat, but moments where other players are being jerks and ruining the game for others is few and far between, but with more customizable options that are reasonably obtainable, something to really go for and earn.. And fall guys turns into something near amazing.\\r<br/>For what it is now\\r<br/>I give Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout\\r<br/>an 8/10 ',\n",
       " \"Honestly it's a good laugh when you're in a group with some mates. It can get frustrating quickly in the team games and I have quit more times than I'd like to admit. Needs more modes and games though! \",\n",
       " 'Generally speaking, the game is a wonderful concept and executed well.  It\\'s lacking in a few areas, but I think it will be polished out in time.  The server issues early on were expected (don\\'t expect an online game to have a flawless online launch.  It just doesn\\'t happen often).  But games like non-team tail tag are simply un-fun.  If the amount of time a tail is held doesn\\'t matter, don\\'t make the game last more than 45 seconds.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>There\\'s a bit of cheating going on, and there is no in-game reporting mechanism.  The PR for this is pretty bad on reddit, where a PR person said basically \"don\\'t submit reports, we\\'ve got a system that detects it\".  User reports should be a valued part of the system, as players will be able to identify these things where the regular system fails.  That\\'s how you evolve these systems.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>There\\'s also some weird latency issues, and it seems like there\\'s a \"tie goes to the lagger\" interpolation.  This really sucks in a few of the game modes.  Finally, there\\'s a griefing element which will always be there, but the grab system doesn\\'t seem to work consistently, and some players have found a way to push many times harder than others.  I\\'m not sure if this is an intended learning curve, a cheat, or just bad design.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Overall, even with the flaws, it\\'s a fun game that makes me want to come back and play more often.  I think that if the developers continue to improve it, it could have a couple years of longevity in it, and good times for all. ',\n",

All games have issues on launch these days, even AAA ones, let alone something like this.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>As for repetitiveness, there are 24 game modes. More to be added in season 2.

If you can't cope with them you're just not good enough and you maybe need to accept that. It is a very hard game, and does need luck for some levels, but some are skill and controls work fine.

A Takeshi's castle gimmick for a game is an excellent idea but the execution isn't really to my liking ..\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The reason for the 5/10 is because I find it expensive for what if offers , otherwise it would have gotten a 7/10 due to it's originality and it's achievement of making people laugh ... \",\n",

       " \"The concept of a competitive platformer battle royale is one that is intriguing and has potential. Unfortunately the competitive potential for Fall Guys is completely lost due to unbearable character control physics, significant input lag and server issues, poor minigame design, and overall complete lack of control over your win odds. Your character moves unpredictably and uncontrollably when bumping into other players, and is unresponsive to inputs. The addition of luck-based minigames means that even if you have control over your character about 1/3rd of the time it does not matter since games are won by sheer chance. Combining all these aspects turns Fall Guys into an incredibly unsatisfying and faulty competitive game.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>As a party game, Fall Guys still is unsatisfying. Games are too fast which means it has no long-term engagement, and the repetitive nature of the minigames (essentially boiling down to four or five different 'types') makes any player that can get over the controls check out quite soon.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Fall Guys is only entertaining for one person: The spectator. Watching other stumble with the controls and fail to do what should be easy things is quite entertaining, even if it's more the fault of the game than it is the fault of the player. \",\n",

If you have a couple friends with you in the same room, each game is quick enough to pass the controller around when you get knocked out. If you have friends online, you can play together. This is a game that is just as fun to play as it is to watch. With a fun aesthetic and a game show vibe, Fall Guys is a new and exciting take on the battle royale genre. ',\n",
       " \"The loading screens take way too much time. The gameplay is NOT sufficiently based on skills. Too much luck involved. It's annoying when the characters fall over and fall off edges. The levels are small, offering only brief moments of gameplay before the next loading screen. \",\n",

       " \"Firstly in terms of visuals this game goes for a heavily stylized cartoony aesthetic and it really works. Every obstacle course or arena is bright and colorful and fun to look at. Everyone controls a strange looking round fella that they can then further customize with different colors silly looking accessories which not only gives incentive to keep leveling up and earning coins so you can unlock more items and emotes but also further adds to the goofy cartoony feel of the game and I mean that in a good way. The animations on these guys, emotes and the normal animations that play before and after rounds also go a long way to add some fun charm to the simple designs on these guys. I also love the silly cartoony sound effects that happen when you fall over or bump into someone. Fall Guys is not the prettiest thing out there but it works and I personally really like it.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>As for how it plays, each game is referred to as an episode, treating this like it really is a Ninja Warrior style TV show.  These episodes are broken up into several rounds where players are steadily eliminated until one player is left standing. The rounds range from Obstacle Course style, reach the end sourt of affairs which are probably my favorite as it really just feels like a test of your platforming skills. There are some slightly annoying parts to these levels like how in see saw you have the risk of being stuck on a seesaw with people who don’t know how balance and weight distribution work, seriously have they never been a freakin seesaw before!...Okay I’m calm, anyway aside from...minor annoyances like that these levels are still pretty fun. My least favorite one of this kind of course is the fake door one, it just feels a bit to luck based as to whether or not you pick the correct door and it then quickly becomes a cluster cluck around the real door, it's not awful I just don’t like it nearly as much.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>There are also some more distinct events that remind me of Mario Party minigames like this one where the objective is to avoid falling off these rolling platforms and this one where you have to avoid being pushed off by blocks. There are more levels like this and they are pretty fun as well, these definitely feel a bit more cutthroat with a lot more people pushing and grabbing each other.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Finally there are some team based events like team tail tag where you want your team to have more tails by the end which is a variant of a solo event where you just have to hold onto your own tail or egg grab where the objective is to have the most eggs in your teams nest at the end. The only one of these events I don’t love is the soccer one because it rarely feels like I am actually in control of literally anything that is happening, its not unfun I just don’t love it. It’s not like I groan out loud when this event comes up in the cycle but it’s just not something I am super into.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Finally there are the final round events like Fall Hill where the objective is to be the first one of the remaining contestants to reach the top of the hill and grab the crown or Hex-a-Gone where you want to be the last one to fall in the slime by jumping around on disappearing hexagon platforms. These events do feel suitably like final round events like the climax of an episode and they are really fun, especially hexagon rush which is my personal favorite. It’s quite a challenge to come out on top but it's really exciting when it happens, I have so far only won like once or twice myself but that's the best thing about Fall Guys. Like any good BR it’s not all about winning. Win or Lose you will still have a blast and that's really the best thing I can say about this game is that it’s really fun, I was never bored when playing this game and more than once I had a big smile on my face while playing.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Oh and while you can purchase currency in the game it is more than doable to just earn stuff through regular play so it doesn’t feel invasive at all and if this helps them release more content later on then so be it assuming future content releases like levels and such are free which as of right now I assume they are. Honestly that is the one thing that does feel a tad lacking is the variety in events and different layouts for said events. There is still a decent amount here for the launch and I’d say the fun factor definitely makes up for it, besides that is something that can be remedied with time.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I’d say this one is definitely worth checking out, regardless of whether you have PS Plus or not. If you want a fun BR that is enjoyable to play even when you are losing and has a focus on platforming and minigame style events than you will love this game, I know I did so I’d say it's definitely worth the price of admission and hey if you DO have PS Plus there is literally no reason to not at least give it a shot if you are even remotely interested so for real go try this game asap. You won’t be disappointed. \",\n",
       " \"The controls didn't feel responsive at all to me. A lot of the time it'll feel like the frames are dropping massively and everything begins moving in slow motion, but that's just normal Fall Guys. As a result, it's like trying to control yourself from a second in the future. The button presses seem like they take half a second to get from your controller to your character. A specific issue involves grab where it won't even work half the time. Other times, the game confuses itself and you can now grab people three meters away. This is a huge issue as some of the mini-games rely completely on the grab mechanic working correctly. The same could be said about the ball mini-games and a lack of responsive controls. It's frustrating to try to play those while your character's actions keep getting delayed (or doesn't do them at all). I'm genuinely baffled at the highly positive response this is getting. It would have felt meh quality for even a free to play game. Different strokes for different folks, I guess. \",\n",

I hate this battle royale trend where they try to get as many players into a game at once. It's irritating just being pushed around by a dozen other players at once. This would be better if the player count was below 30 or if it was a single player game. I don't get the hype. This has been the worst game I have ever played this year.

       " 'Inspired by the likes of Wipeout and Takeshi\\'s Castle, Fall Guys provides a unique take on the battle royale genre. Rather than shooting everyone in sight, you\\'ll compete against 60 other players in a wacky game show filled with insane obstacle courses and goofy team-based challenges where ultimately only one will get to walk away with the crown. Developer Mediatonic did an excellent job of capturing the right tone with the colorful visuals, plethora of silly costumes, amusing physics, and even the spot-on soundtrack. The only thing missing is playful play-by-play and color commentary from a pair of off-kilter announcers.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Despite its almost easygoing appearance however, this is a very competitive experience. It takes legitimate skill, mastery, and sometimes a bit of dumb luck to come out on top, which makes the agony of defeat a very real feeling here and the high of victory that much sweeter. Of course with this being a last man standing takes all kind of game you should expect a lot of losses. Yet, even your worst runs will bare fruit as you are awarded with in-game currency called \"Kudos\" and experience points for the season-based progression system at the end of each match. Both of which will allow you to unlock new cosmetic items for your strange jelly bean looking avatar. You can purchase Kudos with real money via microtransactions, but this has no effect on the content locked behind this game\\'s version of a battle pass so there are no hints of pay-to-win to be found. All putting down your hard earned cash will allow you to do is ensure that you can grab any skin or emote that catches your eye in the shop before it cycles out.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Only time will tell if the community will stick around once the novelty wears off, but as of right now this is some of the most original and exciting multiplayer on the market. It\\'s not going to be for everyone as it seems designed to be just as aggravating as it is fun, but the detractors will certainly be in the minority as of this writting. The game\\'s name seems to be on the lips of so many gamers for good reason as you aren\\'t going to find what it has to offer anywhere else. So go ahead and give Falls Guys a shot to see what all the fuss is about. ',\n",
       " 'Pros: it’s easy to get into, fun with friends to play these small ridiculous maps.\\r<br/>Cons: you play a lot of the same maps over and over and it got old fast for me, has much to do with luck whether you win or not ',\n",

It is a game that was clearly rushed and prioritised quantity over quality. While there is a lot of fun games, there is also so much **** piled into it for content that it just ceases to be fun. Lots needs to be done to fix it otherwise it will be something that is huge for a month and then dies as players get sick of the bull****. ',\n",
       " \"Fall Guys is a breath of fresh air and a great change of pace from all the stereotypical battle royale games we've seen recently. It does something different and does it pretty well.

You do not need to buy a single Kudo pack to unlock any cosmetics in this game. You simply need to win to get kudos and crowns. You are not being forced to buy anything at all. \"The servers lag out.\" The only times the servers have given me any issues was initial release because they got flooded and due to maintenance happening which they announce on their official Twitter. Not to mention the game has been out for maybe 2 weeks? My review:<br/>Fall guys Is a fun game to play alone or with friends, this is a unique take on battle royale games and personally I believe is a step in the right direction.<br/><br/>The name of the game is to be the last one standing in a free for all battle of goofiness and laughs. There is a lot of potential with this game as far as cosmetics collaboration and new game modes/private lobbies.<br/><br/>The one thing I would like to see is different Playlist. ',\n",
       " \"Fall Guys is definitely what I was looking for. It's a Battle Royal game for people who dislike Battle Royals like me. It's pretty simple to play and master and can provide you with countless hours. The action never stops (except for a few crappy team matches where you have very little impact individually and can stay still and win). Devolver Digital once again delivers an absurdly fun and crazy game.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Overall I'd say this was hands-down my most entertaining Battle Royal experience so far and even though it has a few bugs I totally recommend it. Especially since it's free on PS4 if you own a PS+ subscription. The matches are super short and even when you get to the finals and lose it's not much of a deal, just roll the dice again. This game rellies 70% on luck and 30% on skill most of the times and it quite fits the kind of TV show it tries to emulate. \",\n",
       " \"The one word to describe this game would be promising.\\r<br/>The game visually looks like a child's games with its wacky bright colours and simple mini games almost out of Mario Party would make this game easy enough but you would be wrong my friend.\\r<br/>This game does many things right. For starters, you can unlock every cosmetic through hard work and skill which is rare for a battle royal and micro transactions are totally optional. Best part was you didn't have to grind for cosmetics which I was afraid of but it's a good balance of time and reward.\\r<br/>The game is super simple anyone can pick it up. Only 5 controls including camera and movement. There is good variety of mini games it's just some seem to get picked way more often than others. But each one boils down to a team game, race, survival, and logic. And will keep you playing for a good while.\\r<br/>The one big problem I have with this game is that the game looks and feels unfinished. Random BS seems to make you fall every time. Controls will feel unreliable and I just can't stand games where I don't feel in control. But perhaps the worst part I hate is the 59 other players pushing you around every game. You bump into everyone and it's infuriating not to mention grabbing is the worst as it's bugy as hell. Servers and lag is also a big problem as it seems to be a delay between you and other players, everyone is always a few steps back then were they are on your screen. Now that this game has gotten so popular hopefully they upgrade the servers over time.\\r<br/>It's fun don't get me wrong but with future updates I hope they keep adding more mini games and improving these little bugs as it is a new studio. \",\n",

But frustrating in a good way! You never get upset when you’re eliminated, you just dust yourself off and go back at it… and based on how far you get in each episode, you’ll be rewarded points to spend in the shop… and this is where fall guys falls flat on its face.. Content… fall guys ultimate knockout is lacking content big time, and while yes I understand this game is free for PlayStation plus members at the time of this review, fall guys ultimate knockout is not a free game... I repeat, this is not a free to play game...\\r<br/>There are 24 mini games, but with 5 rounds an episode, you get to see all this game has to offer fairly quickly.. That being said that’s not necessarily fall guys biggest problem in the content department... the biggest problem is in its customization... a huge lack of customization options, the store changes every day rather than you saving up your kudos or crowns for a special item you actual want… which leads to thousands of players, looking pretty identical which I feel defeats the whole purpose of a game like a fall guys, this is an individual game show, give me more options to feel like an individual, rather than be a bird or a be a wolf, sorry about the servers you can be a cactus, thanks for the 3 options..\\r<br/>overall I really love fall guys, its dumb fun and really hard to put down, there are a few mini games that can sour the fun a bit like tip toes, and obviously people that find ways to cheat, but moments where other players are being jerks and ruining the game for others is few and far between, but with more customizable options that are reasonably obtainable, something to really go for and earn..

Moreover, I have experience several times at which I go into a game while in a party and my friends stay in the lobby. I have also experienced the other way around where we all queue together and I am left out.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>That being said, it is a fresh take on the usual battle royale genres. These game modes aren't original, but plays well overall. The animation style is cute, fun, and vibrant with a cool array of different customization options.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>I personally really enjoy the soundtrack, but is not as smooth when swabbing between tabs and queuing.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The gameplay can be a mix of frustrating and fun, but that is what makes it satisfying to win. It is a fun game to play for casual gamers. People complaining about this game needing luck to win the team-based modes are understandable, but not out of the ordinary for battle royale games. If you drop in an area with poor loot in another game, chances are you will not last as long.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The amount of modes are alright and I maintain interest for awhile, but I may lose interest if they do not consistently bring new modes. They are competing with big battle royale games with consistent medium to major updates every couple of weeks, so I am not as accustomed to games with fewer updates of this genre. In other words, I really hope this game can keep up with keeping this game fresh with new items and modes to come. To my knowledge, as of writing this, they are already adding a new mode and have talked about seasons which keeps my interest in this game for the foreseeable future.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>For this game in particular, I believe player bases will calm down when the hype train calms down, and therefore I think (and hope) it will be necessary to add cross play in the future.

This game is really simple to pick up and play, you've got 4 main controls move, jump, dive, and grab; thats all you really need.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>While the controls are super easy sometimes when everyone is going to the same place if you ragdoll it could put you behind everyone, which very often is part of the fun but every now and then it can be annoying.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The levels are creative and fun, just sometimes you can get ones you don't like and that could ruin your whole run (For me its Slime Climb I just can't beat it).\\r<br/>Also personally I find that I'm playing some levels so much more than others (like I'm playing dizzy heights or gate crash nearly every few games and rarely play block party or jinxed) I don't know if others have felt like this is happening to them too or not but this makes some levels become repetitive but I can still have fun in the intensity and funniness in the levels and the fall guys.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Right now the cosmetics are limited because it was released a few days ago but the FREE battle pass has about 40 tiers which you can unlock outfits, patterns, colours, face colours, theatrics (emotes), kudos(money) and crowns (wins but also rare money). The store (which you can spend your kudos and crowns in) changes with about 5 things changing alot and 3 main things that stay longer. So far everything in the store doesn't need microtransactions but if you want to spend money to get more kudos then you can. Kudos are also earned after every game you play no matter how well you did. Microtransactions can also be spent a few outfits.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The customization is really good, you can make your fall guy yours. you have patterns with 2 different colours that you can chose then you have top half and bottom half of most outfits which you can mix and match with then you have face colours so you can make your fall guy have a white face, yellow or red and so on. then I think finally you have theatrics which are emotes and your wining podium celebrations. I hope they keep adding new and creative stuff to the customization to keep everyone looking different and fresh.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>This may just be me but I follow fall guys on twitter and to me they just seem like normal people that have made a game. They play it on twitch, they are honest and just seem like a team that made a game for people to like rather than for money, they bring in the community with memes about fall guys. I think they (along with the art style) makes the community feel like an actual community rather than just a bunch of players tweeting at nothing trying to get a response. It makes it feel like everyone is enjoying the game. Their presence in the community makes the community feel positive instead of toxic and personally makes me believe and trust them when they say stuff like they plan to add loads more levels, cosmetics and features.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Thats why I think this game deserves an 9 because it's a very good game. Easy (not too much skill to it), cute and colourful with good customization, alot of the levels are so much fun and the devs say they will keep working on the game to make it bigger and better, and if you get on ps4 with PS+ it is free with no needed microtransactions. But i find that I'm playing some levels more than others (which becomes repetitive and predictable) and sometimes the rush of all the players can sometimes be the difference of qualifying or being eliminated which I can find both fun and frustrating.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Pros\\r<br/>-The Art Style\\r<br/>-Easy\\r<br/>-Fun Levels\\r<br/>-The Customization\\r<br/>-The Community Presence\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Cons\\r<br/>-Some levels can be repetitive and predictable\\r<br/>-Some levels appear more often\\r<br/>-Can be frustrating\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Neutral\\r<br/>-No needed microtransactions but the possibility\\r<br/>-Can be manic \",\n",
       " 'It is a very good game, super fun and more if you play it with friends the skins are still great and the good thing is that you can get several things playing. I had problems with the servers but not currently and I would like that in future updates they bring out more things like new games for you to win since there are currently only 3 and new maps. ',\n",
       " 'This game is sooooo much fun, yes the servers are bad atm but I don’t think they expected this many people to play at once, but either than that. This game is pure enjoyment ',\n",
       " 'The truth is that the first day I understand that it will be wrong, the servers were exploited, but after fixing them it continued to give many connection errors, and it does not even save your experience gained in the game, I hope you fix this because it is unplayable! good, very entertaining ',\n",
       " \"Some of the most fun I've had in a game in years. Basically a battle royal obstacle course game. The games art style is that of a pixar movie/kids cartoon. It is far more challenging than it looks, and you definitely get a sense of accomplishment when you finish a course. The game has occasional server issues, and I've fallen through the map a handful of times, but so far the game runs and performs near perfectly. Definitely worth picking up and trying. \",\n",
       " \"Probably my most disliked Devolver game. Unfinished. Poorly implemented mechanics. There's a few gems, but they are buried under multiple repetitive games that often end up being frustrating for all the wrong reasons.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>The best thing about this game is the fact that it's a roadmap for a better developer too easily improve on. \",\n",
       " 'Besides the first day issue with servers, the game is a fun time and it deserves attention: it\\'s battle royale about managing to go through an obstacle course rather than shooting or killing and if you win the match you get to the next and try to stay alive. There are about 4-5 matches each \"episode\" (I think that\\'s what its called) and each match can last from 1 to 5 minutes, depending on how difficult it is.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Honestly, my only issue is how the game is reliant on luck than actual skills: you can learn the games and eventually get good at them but it\\'s extremely difficult to win because it\\'s solely relied on luck and hardly on anything else. Your fall guy is sluggish and doesn\\'t move fast, he\\'s slow and any hit will make him ragdoll for a brief moment which alone can make you lose some games, and even then you might still love if you just jump wrong or move differently: it wasn\\'t uncommon for me to lose a match despite having an advantage on position. I wish they would make it possible for the others to have a way to recover their position somehow, like a rubber band, because there are many \"races\" in this game and one of the final stages IS a race, so if you start wrong you\\'re gonna lose.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Also, the game gets repetitive fast and that\\'s an issue that should be taken care off soon because people might get tired and leave the game and this game requires players to be playable: I think they should have a custom play where few friends can play other minigames and have specific matches played or simply have custom plays with X amount of players so that you can at least enjoy short matches.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>For the moment, I think it\\'s a fine game: still needs some cure and I hope they expand the game soon because it does get repetitive even after short playing sessions.

       " 'An absolute colorful and silly blast of a time! Fall Guys is a battle royale game like no other by simply not being like the generic \"battle royale.\" This game has all sorts of fun puzzles,mini games,and races all with colorful little guys and bright colors blasting your eyes with a good time! It\\'s absolute eye candy combined with some silly knock out mayhem! ',\n",
       " 'This party game has a lot of charisma, humor and a unique visual style that accompanies the games phenomenally, becoming addictive, although the controls are quite clumsy, especially when it comes to jumping and being all close together. All the players start to stumble and it is not so satisfying to try to move with the character. I understand what they wanted to do, they wanted to give the game more humor, and I respect that, but the problem is that this ends up affecting the gameplay. The games are generally races in which you have to qualify for the next round, the level design is ingenious and accompanies the visual and playable intentions of the game, but without polishing certain aspects that make it somewhat frustrating and that lacks local multiplayer or of any offline modality, also leaving behind, a mode where you can practice these modalities alone, or be able to manually choose the phases when playing with your friends online, which is a sin when even party games of 20 years ago included these very important features that I personally end up enjoying more. We also have a store very similar to previously seen games that have micropayments, and although the game has a lot of content, it is easy to unlock new things and micropayments do not affect the gameplay at all, 20 dollars seems a bit expensive to me. I can recommend it, and I know the game will be updating, which means that if it improves in real ways over time, I can raise the mark and comment on these positives. In itself, it is a very original and addictive party game, but one that lacks a little more effort on the part of the developers to exploit its full potential. ',\n",

There are not many levels in this game and the game gets very repetitive. It\\'s going to strongly depend on how much fun you like playing the game, when it comes to how quickly you will get bored.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>2.Hardly any cosmetics. You barely start the game with any cosmetics to choose from. Even LBP (a VERY similar game when it comes to dressing up your character) back in 2008 (yes, 2008) has tons of different designs and combinations right from the beginning of the game. In this game, prepare to look EXACTLY like every other player online. Even after playing for several hours, I still don\\'t have a way to make myself stand out from other players. Even the selection of cosmetics in the \"store\" are lacking. VERY disappointing.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>3. Microtransaction. Yup, this game has microtransactions. And on top of that, it costs $20 (unless you have PS+, which costs anywhere from $40-$60/year, depending on if you get it on sale).\\r<br/>\\r<br/>4. Gameplay is TERRIBLE. You jump, land and start flopping around on the ground. Even if you don\\'t touch anything.... you can jump, land on flat surface with nobody around and start ragdolling.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>5. The game can be glitchy/laggy. There have been moments (and I even recorded these moments to make sure I was losing my mind) where I would beat someone else at something (like jumping through a hoop before them) but the game registered them beating me at it first.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Good Stuff:\\r<br/>\\r<br/>1. The game is easy to pick up and start playing. Right from the menu, you click \"Play\", jump into a room and battle. Lose? That\\'s ok, you can be in another room battling within seconds after losing the previous level.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>2. The game is cute and has a certain charm to it. The characters are funny and silly.\\r<br/>\\r<br/>Final Thoughts:\\r<br/>I found the game was worth downloading and playing. But within the first 20minutes of playing, I could tell I would probably hardly ever play this game after a couple of days, and I still feel that way now (after it\\'s been a couple of days).

I\\'ve done everything in the game several times over and there\\'s no reason for me to go back to it.
